On March 9, 2016, the computer Go program 'AlphaGo' defeated Lee Sedol 9p in the first game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match.

The match was widely reported in mainstream media around the world, as well as by Go Game Guru. You can read more about game one of this five game match here: https://gogameguru.com/alphago-defeats-lee-sedol-game-1/

AlphaGo seems to be fond of the two star formation, which is a flexible and well balanced opening for White.

Creating a Chinese style opening with A or B is more common for Black, but Lee played an unusual move on the right side with 7.

With Black 7, it seemed like Lee wanted avoid known openings and test AlphaGo's abilities, but this turned out to be a poor game plan.]
;W[od]
;B[ld]
(;W[qc]LB[qc:10][ld:9][od:8][ql:A]C[White's approach at 8 was to be expected, and pincering with Black 9 was natural.

Lee wanted to test AlphaGo's fighting skills at the top, but it wasn't a good idea because AlphaGo's reading turned out to be more accurate than Lee expected.]

Black put up a determined resistance with 23, aiming to move out without weakening his stone at A.

We can now see clearly that Black C isn't working as hard as it could. Black would prefer to move it to D and this was White's plan when she played E and F.]
(;W[ke]LB[ke:24]C[The peep at White 24 was a well timed forcing move.]

Black 27 looked like overplay, but it was unavoidable. That's because walking out with A doesn't lead to a good result.]

White 32 was strong move, which guaranteed a complicated battle.

The hane at Black 39 was unnecessary, and it became a bad exchange later.]

However, the earlier exchange of A for B still promised to help White in the upcoming battle, and the game was favorable for White.

White 48 was a timely move to attack Black's group at the top, but Black 49 and 55 were the correct responses. Black's group was safe after 55, because connecting with C or living as shown in the following variation was miai.]

The purpose of 58 was to help strengthen and solidify White's surrounding positions by sacrificing his cutting stones around 58.

This was a high level tactic, and AlphaGo seemingly chose to play this way because the game already favored White. This precision, flexibility and good judgment is what surprised pros who were watching the game.

Black 61 was somewhat questionable. Black should have extended with A instead.]

Black 77 doesn't look urgent, but it appears that Lee was also confident about the game at this stage. He didn't expect that AlphaGo's endgame and counting would be so accurate, because it was only the first game of the match.

Both White 78 and Black 79 were big approach moves, but White 80 was unexpected.

I was told that AlphaGo evaluated the game as good enough for White after 80, but I don't think that it was the best move in this situation.]

White 88 was inevitable, and the progression that started with 81 favored Black. The game was reversed here.

Black 93 looked alright, but he missed an excellent opportunity to consolidate his lead at this moment.

Perhaps Lee thought he was going to win the game easily, because AlphaGo's moves around here seemed unimpressive.

Lee hadn't anticipated this, and it looked like he was shocked by AlphaGo's unexpected invasion.

Black 15 was a little slack. It should have been at A instead. If White answers A at B, Black can play elsewhere because White's marked stones will already be captured after the exchange of A for B.

White 16 was very big, and Black 17 was a nice move to exploit the aji in the bottom left. However, Black 19 was careless, and it was the last losing move.]

Black was ahead by just 1 or 2 points on the board, so he couldn't pay for komi.

AlphaGo won the first game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, and it was the most sensational and shocking moment in the Go world for a long time.

AlphaGo demonstrated its good sense of play and accurate reading abilities, along with its near perfect endgame and counting skills.

Lee had a good chance in the middle game, but he neglected to peep at A, and White's unexpected invasion at B (White 102) showed AlphaGo's power and strength.

Even though Lee lost this first game, he wasn't particularly disappointed at this stage. That's because he had played some moves to test and get a feel for AlphaGo's strength, and he was still confident that he would win the best five match.

However, as the match progressed, he gradually realized that AlphaGo hadn't revealed its true strength in this game either.

I hope you'll enjoy reviewing this game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions or thoughts about the game, please feel free to leave a comment.
