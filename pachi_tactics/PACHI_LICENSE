Pachi is distributed under the GPLv2 licence (see the COPYING file for
details and full text of the licence); you are welcome to tweak it as
you wish (contributing back upstream is welcome) and distribute
it freely, but only together with the source code. You are welcome
to make private modifications to the code (e.g. try new algorithms and
approaches), use them internally or even to have your bot play on the
internet and enter competitions, but as soon as you want to release it
to the public, you need to release the source code as well.

One exception is the Autotest framework, which is licenced under the
terms of the MIT licence (close to public domain) - you are free to
use it any way you wish.
